# algorithm-complexity-analysis

This is an experimental lab in which I wrote and ran a number of small programs to get a hands on understanding of algorithm complexity. These includes: calculating the nth prime, collatz sequence and matrix multiplication. Each program implements a simple algorithm of a different time complexity. I tested how long each algorithm took to execute on my machine for different inputs. 

Although raw execution time is not an accurate measure of algorithm complexity, it is acceptable for this experiment, since I am not comparing my execution times with others. This is an experiment to see how a function grows as input size increases on my own machine.
